# Hello world :earth_americas:!

## :relaxed: I'm a front-end developer (for me, programming is like a leisure) and:

We are together in this magical world of programming, creating, working hard and transforming other people's lives, through practical, objective and quick solutions.

## :shipit: In my life, i like:

- :computer: program in my free time to develop my personal study projects;
- :minidisc: listening to music;
- :books: read about programming, economics, politics and others;
- :pencil2: write my daily thoughts;
- :bird: take care of my dear little bird;
- :coffee: drink a lot of coffee;
- :beers: drink beer;
- :thought_balloon: do challenges in Codewars (https://www.codewars.com);
- :seedling: take care of my garden.

## :fire: I'd define the programming like this:
